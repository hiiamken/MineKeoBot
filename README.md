## üìñ Overview

**MineKeoBot** is built with cutting-edge technologies using Node.js and Discord.js. Originally designed for the MineKeo Network Minecraft server, it has evolved into a robust solution for:
  
- **Server Security**: Prevent malicious actions (Anti-Nuke, Anti-Raid) and automatically initiate lockdowns & rollbacks.
- **Data Integrity**: Regularly backup server configurations and provide rapid restoration in case of emergencies.
- **Member Verification**: Ensure only legitimate members gain access with a custom, hassle-free verification system.
- **Dynamic Reaction Roles**: Easily assign roles through reactions‚Äîwith support for both multiple and unique role selections.
- **Utility & Moderation**: An array of moderation commands and community engagement tools to keep your server thriving.

## ‚ö° Key Features

- **Anti-Nuke & Anti-Raid**  
  Detect and counteract mass-delete attacks and spam, preserving your server‚Äôs integrity.
  
- **Panic Mode & Automated Rollback**  
  When under attack, trigger Panic Mode to freeze actions, capture rapid backups, and rollback to a safe state with a single command.

- **Scheduled & On-Demand Backups**  
  Seamlessly back up your server‚Äôs roles, channels, permissions, and messages using SQLite for reliable, local data persistence.

- **Intuitive Member Verification**

  A suite of admin commands for kick, ban, mute, and more, paired with detailed logs for audit and rollback capabilities.
